## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Implementing SCRUM breaks the school IT infrastructure project into manageable chunks called sprints (usually 1-4 weeks).  The team focuses solely on the tasks within that sprint, avoiding distractions and context switching from other projects. By focusing on small incremental deliverable each sprint produces, the school management can better managed the expectations and the team will be easier to handle changes in requirement.

Scrum isn't just about speed; it's about delivering high-quality solutions efficiently.  By working in focused bursts with clear goals and open communication, the IT team can deliver the school's infrastructure needs on time and within budget.
```

Library members

5. As a library member, I want to see which books I currently have borrowed and their due dates, so that I can avoid late fees.
6. As a library member, I want to renew my borrowed books online, so that I can extend the borrowing period without visiting the library.
